## üìã Immediate Action Items

### 1. Take Screenshots (30 minutes)

Follow the guide in `docs/SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md` to take 9 screenshots:

```bash
# Screenshots needed:
1. step1-input.png
2. step2-validation.png
3. step3-entities.png
4. step4-editor.png
5. step5-sql.png
6. database-connection.png
7. uml-diagrams.png
8. optimization.png
9. sample-data.png
```

**Save them in:** `docs/screenshots/`

**How to take:**
- Windows: Press `Windows + Shift + S`
- Or use browser screenshot extensions
- Follow the specific instructions in SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md

---

### 2. Update README with University Info (5 minutes)

Edit `README.md` and replace:

**Line 20:**
```markdown
**Institution**: [Your University Name]
```

Change to:
```markdown
**Institution**: √âcole Nationale des Sciences Appliqu√©es - ENSA
```
(Or your actual university name)

**Optional:** Add professor name in the Acknowledgments section (near the end).

---

### 3. Push to GitHub (5 minutes)

Once screenshots are added and README is updated:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\lenovo\OneDrive\Bureau\GL_Projects\3A_GL\NL2SQL_Designer"

# Add new files
git add README.md docs/

# Commit
git commit -m "Add comprehensive README with MDE documentation and screenshots"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** You might need to authenticate with GitHub. Use:
- Personal Access Token (recommended)
- Or GitHub Desktop app (easiest)

---

### 4. Test All Features (20 minutes)

Before presenting, verify everything works:

#### Backend Test:
```bash
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main.py
```
Should show: `INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`

#### Frontend Test:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Should show: `Local: http://localhost:3001/`

#### Full Workflow Test:
1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Enter test prompt (from SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md)
3. Validate ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Generate SQL
4. Try database connection (if MySQL is running)
5. Try optimization analysis
6. Try sample data generation

**If anything fails:** Check backend logs and fix before presentation.

---

### 5. Prepare Presentation (Optional - 30 minutes)

#### Option A: PowerPoint/Google Slides
Create a short presentation with:
- Slide 1: Title, Team, University
- Slide 2-3: MDE concepts (use README diagrams)
- Slide 4-5: Architecture (use README diagrams)
- Slide 6-10: Screenshots of each step
- Slide 11: Innovation points
- Slide 12: Thank you / Questions

#### Option B: Live Demo Only
- Use the application live
- Have `docs/PRESENTATION_NOTES.md` open as reference
- Have README.md open to show diagrams

**Recommendation:** Option B (live demo) is more impressive if everything works.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't push to GitHub
**Solutions:**
1. Use GitHub Desktop app (easiest)
2. Generate Personal Access Token:
   - Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
   - Generate new token with `repo` permissions
   - Use token as password when pushing
3. Try SSH instead of HTTPS (see GitHub docs)

### Issue: Backend won't start
**Check:**
```bash
# Is virtual environment activated?
# You should see (venv) in your prompt

# Is Groq API key set?
cd backend
type .env
# Should show: GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...

# Are all packages installed?
pip list
# Should show groq, fastapi, etc.
```

### Issue: Frontend won't start
**Check:**
```bash
# Are dependencies installed?
cd frontend
dir node_modules
# Should show many folders

# If not:
npm install

# Try deleting cache:
rmdir /s /q node_modules
rmdir /s /q dist
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Screenshots look bad
**Tips:**
- Use 100% browser zoom
- Hide browser UI (press F11 for fullscreen)
- Use consistent window size
- Consider using browser DevTools screenshot (F12 ‚Üí Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Screenshot")
